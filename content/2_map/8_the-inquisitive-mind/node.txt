Synop: Inquis­it­ive minds listen, look, scan, and ask ques­tions. They feed off all those little elements that we do not think of archiv­ing – that they glean from the inter­net, from docu­ments sent by design­ers or from conver­sa­tions they engage in. They will do this in partic­u­lar during the exhib­i­tion, always on the lookout, during inter­views with design­ers from French-speak­ing Switzer­land that are part of the programme; they will conduct them in tandem with the mudac curat­ors.

Under the direc­tion of Scott Long­fel­low, the artists of studio oio immersed them­selves in the work­ings and vision of mudac and the wider land­scape of French-speak­ing Switzer­land by inter­view­ing over 20 local design­ers, arch­iv­ists, and tech­no­logy experts. This year-long resid­ency gave rise to the Archivives project, designed as an archiv­ing system that collects docu­ments and inter­views to explore, using arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence, the unpre­ced­en­ted possib­il­it­ies of what archiv­ing in the future could look like. New tools for enrich­ing and diver­si­fy­ing archived data have been developed to take account of the context in which design projects are developed and how they are perceived, partic­u­larly by differ­ent audi­ences.

The project first takes the form of inter­act­ive inter­views with design­ers in the exhib­i­tion hall, conduc­ted by both a member of the museum’s curat­orial team and AI. This process explores how the digital archives selec­ted and trans­mit­ted by the design­ers can be enriched through inter­ac­tion with AI.
At the same time, studio oio spec­u­lates on the possib­il­it­ies offered by AI and, at the end of the inter­views, offers a digital poster for a mono­graphic exhib­i­tion that imagines what an exhib­i­tion on design might look like in 10 to 15 years’ time.

The Archivives project is made up of two tools: Le Curieux and Le Rêveur, the fruit of oio’s resid­ency at mudac and developed as part of the Archives du Design Roman exhib­i­tion.
