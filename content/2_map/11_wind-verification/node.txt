Text: Based on the anthropological field of social media networks in the context of mass surveillance, "Wind Verification" uses a typological approach based on computer vision technology to analyze video clips with flags on social media. The installation generates the wind that changes with the switching of video clips, and presents it in a visual and sensorial way. While the project showing the possibilities of bottom-up data collection, analysis and processing, it is also presenting a metaphor for the current era: the digital reality is becoming new reality.
