Text: Central to SUPERPROMPT is an avatar that is sometimes inhabited by me, sometimes by anonymous guests (as an extension of the work NEW MEETINGS), and sometimes by a conversational large language model (which I named “Sophie” after a conversation in which ChatGPT had hallucinated a performance I had done for the Whitney 2019 biennial by the same name).
