Guiding users through this otherworldly landscape is Claude, a character driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). Each interaction with Claude influences the storyline, ensuring a distinct pathway for every participant Red the Ocean Around U reverses traditional interactions with AI: users engage with Claude's enigmatic questions generated by LLMs trained on Facey's writings and the collaborators’ emergent questions. The voice guiding this experience is a sophisticated composite that seamlessly merges the voices of the artists and the author.</p><p>The experience is part of a series of web-based commissions at LAS, To Fracture Time is Create an Otherwise curated by Barbara Cueto that brings together artists and writers who use science fiction as both a medium and inspiration to create alternative realities across media. They work together to create imaginaries that re-understand the future as a plural multiverse of world-building possibilities.</p>"},"id":"54f4df1d-23b2-4928-8430-f56ec393785c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"links":[{"url":"https://crosslucid.zone/red-the-ocean-around-u-1","text":"Crosslucid website"}]},"id":"d63359f2-54cf-459d-a512-be66ecf005b6","isHidden":false,"type":"link-list"},{"content":{"links":[{"url":"map/slime-machine","text":"Example link"}]},"id":"c80ebe35-45fe-439e-9e1f-912c2a512396","isHidden":false,"type":"node-relation"}]
