Synop: Our project, Infinite Loop, explores these topics — feeding an Artificial Intelligence with historical rings, spanning over 3000 years of human creation (including pieces from the Antikensammlungen Munich, the Germanisches Nationalmuseum Nuremberg and The Alice and Louis Koch Collection in The Swiss National Museum, Zurich); each embedded with the desires, dreams and realities of the makers of the time. The AI learns from these pieces of jewellery — examining in its own way the meaning of materiality, form and features. Once it has learnt, it begins its own journey of creation — showing us infinite new rings that feel familiar yet somehow distant.
