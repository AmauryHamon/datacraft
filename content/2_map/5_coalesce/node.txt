Synop: Coalesce is a speculative design research project which explores the use of artificial intelligence to create a gender-fluid design language. By using AI image blending and text-to-image AI models, it is possible to create intersections between unnecessarily gendered products and question the biases and stereotypes that are linked to gender identities within the product design industry.

----

Input: razors for women and men and physical prototypes made through 3D sculpting and modelling as reinterpretations of the AI-designed products

----

Formula: AI image blending and text-to-image AI models

----

Output: gender fluid razors

----

Text: The project consists of an interactive installation that showcases the results of blending razors for women and men through a trained AI model and physical prototypes made through 3D sculpting and modelling as reinterpretations of the AI-designed products.
