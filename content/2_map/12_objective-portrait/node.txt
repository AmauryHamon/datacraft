Synop: This project explores whether a differently trained object recognition algorithm can help to understand such relations. If we explicitly train an algorithm on someone’s personal values, can it capture something of their particular way of seeing? While an objec recognition algorithm usually tries to learn the definition of an object, we explore the potential for a subject recognition algorithm: can an AI learn to see the value and meaning of an object for someone?

----

Input: A collection of images annoted with subjective labels according to the personal values of each curator. Number of images ranged from 378 to 120.

----

Formula: AI as a reflective design partner. A play with biais, a connection between the maker of the training and its resulat. Three designers annotate a collection of images representing their fascinations, with subjective labels, indicating different dimensions of their visual concepts. These labels are used to teach an object detection model the designers’ perspectives. Then, they used this trained model on their own design work to evaluate the AI’s potential to prompt self-reflection.

----

Output: Installation
