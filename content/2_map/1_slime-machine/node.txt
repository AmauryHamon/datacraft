Synop:

This research explores the concept of intelligence, the view of machines and their relationship in a more than human way.

The focus of my research is slime mould, and in particular the Physarum Polycephalum species, a non-binary, decentralized, random organism used as a model for thinking about and then developing a new form of computing.

I begin by rethinking intelligence, challenging the brain-centric view that has dominated our society and trying to understand it in all its forms, trying to remove the anthropocentric lens and analyze it in its more-than-human forms. Then, I examine how machines can be reimagined, designing new relationships and better ways to coexist with non-human entities, following an ecology of technology.

The research includes the development of a computer vision algorithm inspired by the behavior of slime moulds, with a focus on edge detection. This algorithm, aaardm.py, starts from randomness and searches for solutions rather than predicting them, providing a philosophical and practical framework for a more ecological and inclusive form of computing.

----

Input: The Physarum Polycephalum species, a non-binary, decentralized, random organism

----

Formula: Development of a computer vision algorithm inspired by the behavior of slime moulds, with a focus on edge detection

----

Output: A new form of computing

----

Text: Through this research I wanted to demonstrate that there are other ways of doing technology, that integrate with the more-than-human world in an harmoniously way, keeping nature at the center of the process and that the conception of a new form of computing is not only material in nature, but refers back to a new way of thinking.
