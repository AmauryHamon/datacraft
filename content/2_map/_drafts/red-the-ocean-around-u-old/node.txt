Text:

Each visitor's journey intricately molds the environment, leaving a unique imprint influenced by their choices, duration of engagement, browser traces, and the collective behavior of all previous explorers.

Every choice, answer and path meshes into an emergent, fluid visual narrative output, as unpredictable and rich as the red ocean tides.  Guiding users through this otherworldly landscape is Claude, a character driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). Each interaction with Claude influences the storyline, ensuring a distinct pathway for every participant Red the Ocean Around U reverses traditional interactions with AI: users engage with Claude's enigmatic questions generated by LLMs trained on Facey's writings and the collaborators’ emergent questions. The voice guiding this experience is a sophisticated composite that seamlessly merges the voices of the artists and the author.

The experience is part of a series of web-based commissions at LAS, To Fracture Time is Create an Otherwise curated by Barbara Cueto that brings together artists and writers who use science fiction as both a medium and inspiration to create alternative realities across media. They work together to create imaginaries that re-understand the future as a plural multiverse of world-building possibilities.
