Synop: Throughout the exhibition, a series of artefacts and instruments act as physical representations of the ai training process. These objects are adorned with narrative imagery that communicates the beliefs and values embedded in these processes. They suggest that these ai training protocols could evolve into rituals for making art with ai, much like liturgical objects found in places of worship

----

Input: Selected Sacred Harp songs, spatialised field recordings of fifteen local choirs throughout the UK and other data from their composition

----

Formula: A songbook of hymnals, singing exercises and a recording protocol. The Songbook was specially developed by Herndon and Dryhurst to make training data for choral ai models. The music for the hymns was written using an ai model, Hymnai, trained on selected Sacred Harp repertoire

----

Output: Songs, Voices, Chorus

----

Text:

“If all media is training data, including art, let’s turn the production of training data into art instead.” – Holly Herndon & Mat Dryhurst
The models used to make these compositions are currently considered cutting-edge in a rapidly developing field. In time, the sonic qualities heard in this work will age and become uniquely
identifiable as coming from 2024.

All Media is Training Data, Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst. Written and Edited by Eva Jäger and Caroline Busta, 2024
